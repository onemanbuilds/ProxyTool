 Since a lot of my discord members don't know what is a proxy or how to get them, i made a tool for it.<br/>
 It uses proxyscrape.com api to get the proxies.

 ```
 - Second method, (only windows) run 
 ```

 ```
 - Third method, download the compiled versions from the releases tab on the right side.
